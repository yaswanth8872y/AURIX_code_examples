 /*\title iLLD_TC4D7_LK_ADS_OVERLAY
 * \abstract The data access overlay (OVC) provides the capability to redirect selected data accesses to the Overlay memory.
 * \description The data overlay functionality provides the possibility of redirecting data read access from a Target memory
 *              (Code Memory) to Overlay Memory for execution. The process usually involves copying code from a non-volatile
 *              Code memory (usually Flash) to volatile Overlay memory (usually SRAM), that makes it possible, for example,
 *              to modify program parameters (which are typically stored in the code memory) during run time of program.
 *              Once copied, an overlay mechanism is instituted (configure required Overlay Control registers). The registers
 *              are prepared to enable/disable the redirection from Target memory (usually Flash) into volatile Overlay memory
 *              (SRAM). The CPU convert the addresses to access the Overlay memory instead the Target memory. Test1 have
 *              been provided in this code example, focused on ensuring that the redirection of memory accesses is accurately
 *              configured.
